1.1 ...I want to create a guide and CLI commands mirroring Git, increasing productivity
without relearning everything.
1.2 ... I want to implement a means of verifying the setup and permissions of the team
to ensure efficient workflow.
2. User story 3: Implement a command allowing the preview of merge conflicts prior to 
resolving them. The task is forming a way to allow this preview of merge conflicts to 
take place. The associated tickets are implementing the merge conflict preview and 
the ubsequent addition of user interface that allows the merge conflict preview.
3. This is not a user story. A user story describes a feature and / or requirement
in a development project. This has no clear goal which shows an obvious user need.
It essentially lacks specificity. This is a task.
